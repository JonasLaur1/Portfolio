                    <p>I created this movie searching app to practice my ReactJS fundamentals. You can search for a movie, add it to your favorites and remove it too. Also it uses local storage so after refreshing your favorites will stay there</p>

                    <p>This is the current project that I am working on with my classmates for University assignment. It is iOS and Android app built on React Native. Basically you can create a group, invite friends and create events that would be visible for everyone in the group. I worked only on front-end on this one.</p>

                    <img src="images/ToDo.png" alt="Weather app project">
                    <p>I created a ToDo App to enhance my JavaScript skills. This project features a more extensive use of JavaScript compared to my previous work. Additionally, I implemented localStorage for the first time, allowing tasks to be saved and persist even after the browser is refreshed. This app not only helped me practice JavaScript but also provided valuable experience with client-side data storage.</p>

                    <p>After making a calculator I decided to try something a little harder with JavaScript so I decided to make a weather app. Together with JavaScript I got to use API for the first time so that was interesting too to see how it works even if it is a very simple project. Overall I am quite happy with it since it is working fully how I wanted it to work.
                        Although I really want to improve design of it since it still doesn't look good and appealing but for the moment that will do the job. Also I want to add city suggestions, that when you are typing in the search box it would suggest cities that start with those letters.</p>
